Collection "user", path "$email"
    email:  String
    name:   String
    online: bool
    key:    String

Collection "friends", path: "$email"
    friend:   Map<String, String>
    outbound: Map<String, String>
    inbound:  Map<String, String>

Collection "chats", path: "$email"
    $recipientEmail: List<Map<String, String>>

Collection "private", path: "$privateRoomId"
    "messages": List<Map<String, String>>


NB! In the collection "chats", the messages are stored as a List of maps.
That is because the List holds the messages in the order they were sent and 
the maps hold the contents of the message. The maps hold only one key-value pair, 
where the key is who sent the message and the value is the message itself.
